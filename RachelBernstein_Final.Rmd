## The U.S. Southwest in Climate Models

As the impacts of global climate change become increasingly evident,
it's increasingly important to improve our understanding of what future
climate may look like. Models today generally uphold the “wet gets
wetter, dry gets drier” theorem and forecast increasingly arid and
expansive subtropical bands, including in the U.S. Southwest. Much of
the drying of the Southwest in models arises from exceptional predicted
land surface warming. Though a warmer atmosphere will hold more
moisture, models predict that increases in evapotranspiration will
outpace any increase in precipitation.

During times of past warmth and corresponding high CO~2~, however, the
geologic record in the Southwest shows a much wetter climate. Regional
Pliocene records show evidence of a much wetter Southwest amidst a 400
ppm CO~2~ climate. Due to even higher atmospheric CO~2~ and
temperatures, the Miocene may provide a more useful tool for comparison
with end-of-century warming projections. Understanding how and why the
regional geologic record and model predictions are misaligned is
critical in providing policymakers and the public with the information
necessary to prepare for future climate-driven impacts.

## What is Paleoclimate?

Paleoclimatology is the reconstruction of past climate based on the
geologic record. Paleoclimatologists use proxy archives, natural
phenomena with established relationships to climate, to reconstruct past
climates. An example of a proxy archive that's easy to visualize is a
tree ring. Tree rings vary in thickness depending upon climatic
conditions, such as water availability and temperature, during the year
in which the ring was formed. When looking at a tree, then, you can make
inferences about how much rain the region in which the tree grew during
a certain year depending upon how thick or thin the corresponding tree
ring is. Of course, in this example, your precipitation record could
only extend back for as long as the tree was alive. To reconstruct
climatic conditions during geologic epochs long past, geologists often
perform stable isotope analysis on various forms of carbonate.

## Carbonates and Isotopes

Carbonates form by precipitation out of some source solution. In the
ocean, this source solution is the ocean itself. In soil, this source
solution is meteoric water, or precipitation. As water leaches through
soil, carbonate precipitates out and fills in any gaps present. This can
take many forms, including small nodules:

Just like tree ring thickness, the isotopic composition of a carbonate
is dependent upon regional climate. Global ice volume and global
temperatures affect the isotopic composition of carbonates in the ocean.
Soil carbonates are affected by regional temperature and precipitation
seasonality. When performing stable isotope analysis, the composition of
all carbonates are partially dependent upon the isotopic composition of
its source solution. In reconstructing past climate using stable isotope
analysis of soil carbonates, then, you may be able to make inferences
about past precipitation and temperature, but the results you are seeing
are also informed by precipitation isotopic composition.

## Clumped Isotopes

Carbonates (CO~3~) contain both carbon and oxygen isotopes, considered
stable because they do not decay into other forms over time. Traditional
stable isotope analysis calculates the ratio of ^13^C to ^12^C and ^18^O
to ^16^O in a sample and compares it to the ratio found in a known
standard. ^13^C and ^18^O each weigh slightly more than their lighter
counterparts. This difference in weight leads to preferential selection
of isotopes in certain processes like evaporation and precipitation. A
lighter isotope is easier to evaporate while a heavier isotope is easier
to rain out. Because of these preferences, inferences can be made about
climatic conditions from stable isotope analysis.However, as mentioned
above, the isotopic composition of a carbonate is also influenced by the
isotopic composition of its source solution.

Clumped isotopes refer to a carbonate molecule that contains both a
^13^C and ^18^O (^13^C^18^O^16^O~2~). The formation of these molecules
is solely temperature-dependent - groups on the righthand side of the
equation below are preferentially formed at lower temperatures and D~47~
CO~2~ produced during carbonate dissolution will indicate the
carbonate’s proportion of ^13^C^18^O^16^O~2~:

^12^C^18^O^16^O~2~^2-^ + ^13^C^16^O~3~^2-^ « ^13^C^18^O^16^O~2~^2-^ +
^12^C^16^O~3~^2-^

In analyzing clumped isotopes, it's possible to reconstruct an
independent regional past temperature record.

## Methods

I will use carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to reconstruct
Southwestern temperatures during the Miocene, beginning with the Miocene
Climate Optimum (MCO). This period captures a major, sustained, and
global cooling trend as observed in both benthic d^18^O records of
carbonate and sea-surface temperature (SST) records derived from
alkenones. The total global SST cooling is thought to be approximately
6°C, which potentially bounds the total temperature increase predicted
from end-of-century projections.

I will use a well-dated and stratigraphically well-documented set of
sediments preserved within the Rio Grande Rift in northern New Mexico
and hosted within the Santa Fe Group. These sediments contain abundant
authigenic carbonates and a nearly continuous record of sedimentation
since the onset of the MCO (\~17 Ma) to upper Rio Grande integration in
the latest Miocene (\~6 Ma). Below, find the average d18O value of each
section plotted at the site at which the section is found. Note that this map does not represent the temporal variation across sites.

After analyzing for stable isotopes, I will select approximately 20
samples representative spatially and temporally across the Neogene and
analyze for clumped isotopes at CU Boulder.

## Hypotheses

Given the evolution of global climate during this period, I hypothesize
that Southwestern temperatures will mirror the evolution of global
temperature trends (solid line in Fig. 1 below) but be more pronounced
given the expected greater sensitivity of land surface temperatures to
warming. This hypothesis posits that Southwestern temperature is
particularly sensitive to CO­~2~ forcing and that any large changes
observed in Miocene hydroclimate must contend with potentially
substantially higher temperatures. This hypothesis is supported by the
rare plant fossils that have been found in the northern Rio Grande Rift
during the mid-Miocene, including a palm frond that suggests year-round
above-freezing conditions \~ 15 Ma.

Alternatively, clumped isotopes are particularly sensitive to the timing
of carbonate formation. Today, northern New Mexico experiences a two
wet-season climate with summer-time precipitation delivered from the
Gulf of Mexico via the North American monsoon and winter-time
precipitation sourced from the eastern Pacific and delivered by the
Westerlies. The precise establishment of this hydroclimate regime is
poorly constrained; however, some work has posited that the North
American Monsoon may have been largely inactive prior to the opening and
flooding of the Gulf of California. Because carbonate formation is
sensitive to the timing of precipitation, I propose an alternative
hypothesis where Southwestern temperatures will reach a minimum and then
increase once the monsoon starts to deliver substantial precipitation
(dashed line in Fig. 1), indicating a control based on precipitation
seasonality.

## Preliminary Results

To interpret the preliminary d18O results, which are a ratio of ^18^O to
^16^O, I assigned a bulk age to each section where samples were
collected.

```{r, fig.width = 9.5, fig.height = 7}
# Bulk d18O

# Setup

data <- as_tibble(read.csv("bernstein_data_12.3.csv", header = T))

carb <- data %>%
  filter(no.carb == "FALSE") %>%
  filter(reweigh0.5 == "FALSE") %>%
  filter(Sample != "AB2 63.6") %>%
  filter(Sample != "AB2 65.6") %>%
  filter(Sample != "PS cong 11") %>%
  filter(Sample != "AB2 4.1") %>%
  filter(Sample != "PSBLM 20") %>%
  filter(Sample != "PSBLM 24") %>%
  filter(Sample != "AB 41.3") %>%
  filter(Sample != "AB 8.5") %>%
  distinct(Sample, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    plot_d18O = if_else(is.na(Average.d18O), d18O, Average.d18O),
    plot_d13C = if_else(is.na(Average.d13C), d13C, Average.d13C),
  ) %>%
  group_by(Section) %>%
  mutate(
    section_d18O = mean(plot_d18O),
    section_d13C = mean(plot_d13C)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Site.Section) %>%
  mutate(
    site_lat = mean(Section.Lat),
    site_long = mean(Section.Long)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    site_d18O = mean(section_d18O),
    site_d13C = mean(section_d13C)
  )

# Plot

ggplot(carb, aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Bulk.Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")), 
    y = "Bulk Age (Ma)")
```

<!-- ![](www/bulk-age.jpg){width="600"} -->

I also plotted each sample's d18O by section and relative stratigraphic
height, which correlates to age within each section (where older
sediments are at the bottom of a section and younger sediments are at
the top).

```{r, fig.width = 8.5}
# Faceted
carb %>%
  filter(Section %in% c("4S", "AB", "AB2", "BM", "KP", "SEZ", "SEZe", "WAC", "WW", "CH", "LL19")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Strat.Height)) +
  facet_wrap(~Section, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")), y = "Stratigraphic Height (m)")
```

<!-- ![](www/full-data.jpg){width="600"} -->

Subsequently, I plotted each section alone - combining sections which
were collected on different days from the same area.

```{r}
SEZ <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "SEZ" | Section == "SEZe")

AB <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "AB" | Section == "AB2" | Section == "4S")

  filter(Section == "PS" | Section == "PSBLM")

BM <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "BM")

KP <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "KP")

WAC <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "WAC")

WW <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "WW")

LL19 <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "LL19")

CH <- carb %>%
  filter(Section == "CH")

```

## Preliminary Interpretations

The key element about isotopes that I am using to interpret my data is
the preferential selection of heavier vs. lighter isotopes in natural
processes like evaporation and raining out. Since we are looking at
terrestrial data, all of these carbonates precipitated from rain water.
Today, New Mexico and the U.S. Southwest are part of a two-wet season
hydroclimate. In essence, in the winter, precipitation is driven by the
Westerlies from the eastern Pacific across the Rockies to the Southwest.
In the summer, the North American Monsoon drives moisture from the Gulf
of Mexico northwards across the plains to the Southwest.

Winter precipitation has to cross the Rockies, which forces a lot of
precipitation to rain out before reaching the lee side of the mountains.
Since ^18^O rains out slightly more easily than ^16^O, the remaining
precipitation that falls in northern New Mexico is lower in d18O than
summer precipitation, which only travels across the plains and is
therefore relatively higher in d18O. We can therefore interpret lower
d18O values as a relatively winter-wet climate and higher d18O as a
relatively summer-wet climate.

Looking at our Bulk Age vs. d18O plot again, we see a stable trend until
around 14 Ma, when d18O begins to fall. This fall continues until around
9 Ma, when d18O begins to strongly increase. The data then seems to shift back towards lower d18O around 3 Ma - but this could be due to low outliers.

```{r, fig.width = 9.5, fig.height = 7}
# Bulk d18O
ggplot(carb, aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Bulk.Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")), 
    y = "Bulk Age (Ma)")
```

The range of d18O change in some sections is significantly larger than
others, however. In the SEZ section, the range is approximately 12 per mil. In
the BM section, the range is about 8 per mil. In comparison, AB, AB2,
and 4S, which are all part of the same site, only range about 3.5 per
mil across the entire site.

Some Pliocene (earlier than 5 Ma) data is also from the same area as AB, AB2, and 4S. To create a trend spanning both the Miocene and Pliocene in the same geographic region (nearby Albuquerque), I stacked these sections atop each other - with approximately 100m stratigraphic gaps denoting gaps in time between the data.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
colors <- c("#F8766D", "#E68613", "#CD9600", "#C77Cff", "#ED68ED", "#FF61CC")

alb <- carb %>%
  filter(Section %in% c("4S", "AB", "AB2", "SEZ", "SEZe", "WAC"))

ggplot(alb, aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Master.Strat)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 200, 400, 600),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(~ rev(./41),
                     name = "Age (Ma)")) +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")),
    y = "Stratigraphic Height (m)"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors)
```


And, compared with the bulk age plot:

```{r, fig.width = 9.5}
colors <- c("#F8766D", "#E68613", "#CD9600", "#C77Cff", "#ED68ED", "#FF61CC")

masterstrat <- ggplot(alb, aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Master.Strat)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")),
    y = "Stratigraphic Height (m)"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors)


bulkd18O <- ggplot(carb, aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Bulk.Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")), 
    y = "Bulk Age (Ma)")

ggarrange(masterstrat, bulkd18O,
          nrow = 1,
          ncol = 2,
          widths = c(1.3, 1.6)
          )
```

This comparison is interesting because around 10 Ma (approximately, since the 100m gaps to indicate missing time are somewhat arbitrary), the Albuquerque data seems to imply a shift towards a summer-wet climate while the broader trend is clearly shifting towards a winter-wet climate.

Our outliers are generally also relatively higher in d18O (with the exception of a couple really low outliers in the WAC data). This could potentially
drive some of that late trend by dragging the overall trend towards
higher d18O. However, one thing to keep in mind is that there
is still an age range within each section. It's possible that there are
strong trends within a section itself that are not expressed by
assigning a bulk age.

An interesting factor to consider as well is that our d13C and d18O
trends are highly correlated. Oftentimes, this is seen in evaporative environments, since evaporation prefers both ^12^C and ^16^O to ^13^C and ^18^O, respectively. These are not evaporative environments, however. One way to interpret this correlation is because of the increase in productivity in Western ecosystems in winter-wet climates. Summer precipitation is quickly transpired by plants - winter precipitation is able to recharge groundwater, ultimately leading to more productive environments. Since lower d13C is correlated to higher primary productivity and lower d18O is correlated to increases in the share of winter precipitation, this explains the correlation present in the data.

```{r, fig.width = 9.5}
# d13C and d18O
bulkd18O <- ggplot(carb, aes(x = plot_d18O, y = Bulk.Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^18, "O ‰")), 
    y = "Bulk Age (Ma)") +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )

bulkd13C <- ggplot(carb, aes(x = plot_d13C, y = Bulk.Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Section)) +
  geom_smooth(orientation = "y", se = F) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(
    x = expression(paste(delta^13, "C ‰")), 
    y = "Bulk Age (Ma)") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none"
  )

ggarrange(bulkd13C, bulkd18O, 
          ncol = 2,
          nrow = 1.5,
          widths = c(1.3, 1.6))
```

In all, preliminary data shows a slight decrease in d18O from 17 Ma to 9
Ma, when d18O begins to increase strongly until 5 Ma. This implies a
slight shift towards majority winter precipitation until 10 Ma, when a
strong shift towards summer precipitation begins. This shift lasts until around 6 Ma, when the trend falls back towards winter-wet. However, this later trend is likely significantly affected by the low outliers in the WAC data.

Some work thus far has
posited that the North American Monsoon came into effect for the first
time during the Miocene with the opening of the Gulf of California
around 6.4 Ma (Chapin 2008, Oskin and Stock 2003). One way to build upon this preliminary data is to collect more late Miocene and Pliocene data to increase the resolution around this timeframe.

The Miocene is also particularly interesting in temperature trends because it
contains both the MCO and the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT).
After running samples for clumped isotopes in the spring, I will
reconstruct a temperature record to compare with this stable isotope data.
